# Backlog Execution Scoreboard

Last updated: 2026-03-06
Owner: Founder

This file is the live execution board for orchestrated Codex sessions.
Rule: keep exactly one `Now` item active until its definition of done is met.

## Snapshot

- Objective: Finish whole-product backlog with blocker-first sequencing.
- Current bottleneck: Closing event-driven billing integrity gaps from manual status mutation paths.
- Active lane: `revenue + reliability debt`

## Now

- [ACTIVE] `BL-REV-009` `revenue` Replace manual status edits with event-driven transitions from real payment events
  - Why: Audit marked this as highest-severity remaining billing integrity risk.
  - Definition of done:
    - Invoice/subscription status APIs reject event-owned transitions without explicit override controls.
    - Admin UI no longer encourages direct manual mutation for event-owned states.
    - Integration tests verify event-driven transitions remain authoritative.
  - Validation:
    - `npm.cmd test`
    - `npm.cmd exec tsc --noEmit`
    - `npm.cmd run -s lint`
  - Est: 4-6h

## Next

- [READY] `BL-REL-002` `platform` Harden activity-log write failures with explicit alerting and fallback telemetry
- [READY] `BL-TEST-002` `quality` Add regression checks for new admin audit and webhook-incident surfaces
- [READY] `BL-OPS-005` `platform` Add operator quick-links to incident runbook from revenue/incident screens

## Blocked

- None
