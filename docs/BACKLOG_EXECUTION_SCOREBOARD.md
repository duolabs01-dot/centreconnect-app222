# Backlog Execution Scoreboard

Last updated: 2026-03-06
Owner: Founder

This file is the live execution board for orchestrated Codex sessions.
Rule: keep exactly one `Now` item active until its definition of done is met.

## Snapshot

- Objective: Finish whole-product backlog with blocker-first sequencing.
- Current bottleneck: Revenue UI still exposes stale manual status controls after backend guard changes.
- Active lane: `revenue + reliability debt`

## Now

- [ACTIVE] `BL-REV-010` `revenue` Remove stale manual status controls from admin revenue UI
  - Why: Backend event-driven guards are live; UI should not present unsupported manual transitions.
  - Definition of done:
    - Revenue operations UI no longer offers event-owned status mutation actions.
    - UI copy clarifies event-driven billing transitions.
    - Operator actions align with supported collect/resend/replay controls.
  - Validation:
    - `npm.cmd exec tsc --noEmit`
    - `npm.cmd run -s lint`
    - Manual sanity check in `/admin/revenue`
  - Est: 2-3h

## Next

- [READY] `BL-REL-003` `platform` Add persistence-backed throttling for activity-log failure alerts
- [READY] `BL-QA-003` `quality` Extend smoke checks to cover activity-log alerting failure simulation
- [READY] `BL-UX-010` `admin` Add read-only status guidance panel to Revenue Ops for operator clarity

## Blocked

- None
